Plant traits are plant properties that are used to describe how plants function how they interact with the environment. Due to global change, the biosphere is being transformed at an accelerating pace. 
We can hardly project on a global scale how plant traits and as such entire ecosystems will react to climate change because we do not have sufficient data on plant traits.
A pioneering study from 2021 showed that artificial intelligence can predict plant traits from such photographs using Convolutional Neural Networks, although the dataset was very small and could've been improved.
This project aimed to further unlock the potential of predicting plant traits, such as plant height and leaf area, from plant images.
